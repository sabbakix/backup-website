We are going to create a Desktop App using web tecnologies. Here a list of tools we are going to use:

    - node js
    - vite
    - blueprint js
    - CSS Grid
    - electron js

# Setup

First thing first, we will install the lastest stable node environment. Download and install Node from the official website https://nodejs.org/

Once installed text your setup with the following command

    node --version
    v20.11.0

We start our new project using the **vite** framework 

    npm create vite

It will ask you the name of your project and then select the type of environment that you want to use.

We choose to use "**React**" with "**Typescript+SWC**". SWC is a fast and new  Rust-based bundler. Onece finished the setup o inside the folder newly created

    cd project-name
    npm run dev
